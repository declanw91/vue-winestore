# vue-winestore

## Overview

A vuejs project to help me learn vuex, vue router and using state as well as using components. 

The project is a simple wine store that allows users to browse the wines either by colour, region or the full range. It also has a cart feature that currently just allows users to add to the cart and view their cart to see what items they have added. The cart feature will eventually be expanded. The styling mainly comes from bootstrap and it also uses font awesome for some icons as I do not currently have a lot of images for the site.

This is a project I work on in my spare time to learn and practice VueJS as I try to learn the newer JS frameworks.

Based on a tutorial from FreeCodeCamp which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4deVCNJq3qc
